			<h1>Blog #1 me</h1>
			<p> The purpose of the video was to explain the hardships of homosexuality and the way it is delt with through many people. It also explains the difficulties with homosexuality with family, reglion and the self. Many homosexuals have so much criticism that it takes over their lives. In the video, Uncle Ronnie took his life due to the difficulties of family and relgion. His nephew now lost his family and is in the same situation as his Uncle Ronnie.</p> 
			<p>In the video Randy achieves showing the purpose of the video by explaining that he has always dreamed to be like his uncle and now that he is older he realizes that he is exactly like him. Homosexual and lost his family. In this situation, Uncle Ronnie took his life, but Randy explains that if you get over all that life is beautiful. Finding love is a beautiful thing and he explains this at the end. Finding love is beautiful and no matter the hardship, it makes life worth living. </p>
			<p>The structure of the message is heart-felt and ties you in with the sorrow in Randy's story. The messsage starts by showing the hardahips in relgion of homosexuality and then shared his Uncle's story. After explaining his uncles story he explains that he is in the same situation. The structure ties you in even more when he explains how he over came the situation when his Uncle Ronnie took the easy way out. He had the same harhships but he explains life beautifully unlike his Uncle ever saw life.   
			<p> This video can help me revise my paper with the way it unfolds. He starts by hooking you in with the information of homosexuality and how it can be very hard to be accepted. Second he explains his own experience and then in the end relates to it and how he over came it. My paper goes right into what I see, but I could start it off with my father's story because that is who I am looking up to the paper. Then at the end I can explain his impact on me.  </p>
