			<p> The purpose of the video was to explain the hardships of homosexuality and the way it is delt with through many people. It also explains the difficulties with homosexuality with family, reglion and the self. Many homosexuals have so much criticism that it takes over their lives. In the video, Uncle Ronnie took his life due to the difficulties of family and relgion. His nephew now lost his family and is in the same situation as his Uncle Ronnie.</p> 
			<p>In the video Randy achieves showing the purpose of the video by explaining that he has always dreamed to be like his uncle and now that he is older he realizes that he is exactly like him. Homosexual and lost his family. In this situation, Uncle Ronnie took his life, but Randy explains that if you get over all that life is beautiful. Finding love is a beautiful thing and he explains this at the end. Finding love is beautiful and no matter the hardship, it makes life worth living. </p>
			<p>The structure of the message is heart-felt and ties you in with the sorrow in Randy's story. The messsage starts by showing the hardahips in relgion of homosexuality and then shared his Uncle's story. After explaining his uncles story he explains that he is in the same situation. The structure ties you in even more when he explains how he over came the situation when his Uncle Ronnie took the easy way out. He had the same harhships but he explains life beautifully unlike his Uncle ever saw life.   
			<p> This video can help me revise my paper with the way it unfolds. He starts by hooking you in with the information of homosexuality and how it can be very hard to be accepted. Second he explains his own experience and then in the end relates to it and how he over came it. My paper goes right into what I see, but I could start it off with my father's story because that is who I am looking up to the paper. Then at the end I can explain his impact on me.  </p>

			<p>While writing my Lived Experience paper I ran into some issues such as how to connect technology to business. In theory the task sounds very simple, but it is very difficult to put this together. I have looked through numerous websites but they are on certain companies or taken place in other countries. I talked to my father because he is a business owner and that was a little more helpful. Although the data bases that we were assigned to use that were through the school were not nearly as helpful as the regular internet. Although the data bases sited many of the sources for me so that was extremely helpful.</p>
			
			<h4>Blog #3</h4>
			<p>I have finally wrapped up my Lived Experince Paper! I had trouble as I said before finishing the paper and making it long enough but I felt good about my final paper once I turned it in. I had trouble trying to figure out how to put it on GitHub but I got it in the end.</p> 
			<p>While writing this paper I noticed that I was not interested in the subject that I was writing about which was my business major. I found myself disliking the research due to the fact that it was mostly boring to me. I was not interested in information that my father told me or anything that I found on the internet. Although I was pretty far into my paper so starting over was not an option. Even though I felt I did well on the paper, I did not enjoy writing it. After writing this I'm not sure if I am interested in the business field any longer.</p>

			<p>The people that were targeted in this video is video game addicts who spend a lot of their time if front of the computer or television playing video games. Many young kids and even older adults spend a lot of time playing video games. For example, I have a younger brother who is in highschool still. Right when he returns from school everyday he goes straight upstaris to play video games. It drives my mom crazy and she always tries to get him to come downstairs. Although, when he finally does come down for dinner, he goes right back up after. Video games are not necessarily a bad habit, but spending almost all your days playing video games can become a problem.</p>
			<p>The social issue explained in the video comes with the idea of spending a lot of time in either in front of a television or computer. Not only is this addiction a social issue, but it can also be a health issue as they displayed in the video. Getting physical activity escpeically as a child is extremely important. Although the social issue in with this problem pertains to the idea that sitting in front of a computer all day can affect the persons social skills. Without talking to real people for an extended amount of time can possibly take a toll on the way a person acts in a public setting with other people. It could also affect a child more than an adult. Generally adults did not have the option to play video games when they were younger like we do today. Therefore, they grew up with no choice but to learn how to be social. Although children in the present have the internet and games at hand almost all the time whether they are at home on a computer or anywhere else on their phone. Parents now need to worry about strssing the idea for thier kids to become social. Again, my brother is extremely quite to the point where my mom gets angry because he barely speaks. When a question is asked he responds with 'yes' or 'no'. My grandparents also find it very annoying and even try to ask questions where he has to say more than just one word answers.</p>
			<p>Like my view, the creators' view also associates with the idea that children of our generation are addicted to video more than they have ever been. In the Southpark episode, they joked about outside acitivities worthless compared to video games which they referred to as meaningful and a better use of time. This then as I explained before, this affects childrens physical activities and increasing the chances for the child to become overweight and socially awkward. This may not also be the case, the chances increase greatly with this lifestyle</p>

			<p>We were assigned the Cultural Analysis Paper which lets us examine society and discuss the things that are wrong or what we believe to be wrong and are in need of change. I spent the class time researching possible topics such as racial profiling or eating disorders. Eating disorders have been a serious problem with teens in the US for a number of years. Although I did not feel eating disorders could really be changed through society. With that in mind, I looked at aspects that may cause teens to feel the need to be skinny. With this came peer pressure and the dangerous need to be skinny. But where did this come from I thought? Then the final question hit me, where are teens finding the need to be skinny? The media. I then decided to write about the media and the effects it has on teens in society.</p>
			
			<h7>Blog #6</h7>
			<p>While continuing my Cultural Analysis paper I was in need of finding a way to connect eating disorders with the media. From there I looked at numerous ways that drove teens to do dangerous things to thier body in order to be skinny. While researching I found many interviews with teens discussing how they wanted to look like thier favorite Hollywood star. That in it self was the answer. These teens want to look like the stars they see in magazines and will starve themselves to look like that.</p>
			<p>Although what many people do not know is that many of thier favorite stars and models do not actually look the way they do in maagazines as they do in reality. The altering of the body and skin is done through a process called Photoshop. After finding the topic that ties the media and eating disorders together, the paper became much easier and I enjoyed writing and researching about it. I found many astounding facts such as how much a person can be altered through photoshop. With this process anyone can look like the model that they see in the magazines. Knowing these facts I found the idea of Photoshop to be very depressing. Even these beautiful models were not enough so the computer fixed thier "flaws" or the things that made the person them. In the end, I found teens were striving to be things that even thier favorite models were not becoming a never ending cycle. All in all I believed that Photoshop needed to be stopped and I was very excited about the final paper I turned in because I felt the reader will feel the way I do after they read it.</p>

		<p> In the ad, the imagery of Detroit combined with the background music of "Lose Yourself" sends chills through the body. The obvious main point of the commercail is to sell Chrysler cars. Showing the images of Detroit make a person, espeacilly from this area feel proud about it and hopefully pushing one to continue making it a better place.The commercail portrays that buying buying Chrysler is buying American. It does this in the end when it says Imported from Detroit. I beilieve it's showing that buying American cars the money will inject back into the economy, for example back into Detroit to build the city back to what it used to be. Truly, the song and images of Detroit don't fantisize the city but show the real place of hardships and the city hopefully coming out of it. Hopefully doing this through buying a Chrysler 200. </p>

		<p>Our Formal Research paper will definetly be one of the most difficult papers that we will have to write for this class. While looking over the requirements it is the longest paper invloving the most informarion not only from the internet but also from interviews that we will have to set up. Also, the report is on like the first paper a major. Knowing how I felt about writing the first paper I do not think doing business would be a good idea again. Knowing that I started looking into other areas of study and started looking into the medical field. All the information that I was reading I found very interesting. I then decided to write my report about the medical field such as the steps to become a medical personale inloving the specfic requirements and the amount of years in school needed.</p>
		<p>Finding information for this topic was not difficult, in fact there was more than enough information on the steps to a medical personale but I am finding it difficult to set up interviewsw with two people. I have one time set up and I am hoping I get the other. Besides the interviews, the rest of the project has been going very smooth. Setting up the paper is not too difficult because I will start off with certtain requirements needed as an undergradute, graduate and so on. Before doing this research I was not aware how difficult the entrance into the medical field was. All in all, the process of my research paper has been going very well.</p>

		<p>As I said before the research paper is coming along well although I feel a little farther behind after spring break. I am also still looking for my last interview but I was able to get the first one finished. Coming up with enough questions was difficult because the questions I did have planned were answered fairly quickly. This interview was the one with a person who teaches the course. It was very interesting to hear the information from a professor rather than a student. The rest of the paper is coming along although I am still short on words but I am hoping after my final interview the paper will be long enough.</p>

		<p>Today I fianlly turned in my finished Formal Research Report. I am very excited about the end result. I was able to reach the word count needed and do both interviews. I feel the information given in the paper is not only consisent but a pre-med student could use the information to help plan their path. After writing this paper I definitely have a lot of respect for students entering the medical field because as I have learned it is an extremely rigorous path. A student at minimum will spend about 11 years becoming a medical personale. Although at the end of thier road if they have suceeded, it will be very rewarding considering the amount of yearly pay. All in all I feel very good about the report turned in. As I said before, I was able to complete this paper with ease although I had difficulty entering it onto GitHub. I was unable to update it correctly so it would not load onto my portfolio. I was able to figure it out when I went to class the next week.</p>

		<p>Completing the Remix Project was not an easy task, but not as difficult as I expected it to be. The difficult part of the project was probably trying to make times that was easy for everyone to meet and of course using IMovie. Although I was lucky enough to have someone in my group that was somewhat famalair with the process. We decided to do our documentary on Photoshop as me and someone else in my group did thier Cultural Analysis paper on. When we first met as a group we discussed how to layout the documentary in a way to make the auidence feel the way that we do at the end of the video. With that in mind we started off by showing the differences between a photoshopped picture and a picture that has not been altered. Then we decided that we wanted to show the audience how this process was done. Wedid this by talking to a photoshop major and showing a video with the steps. After we showed how different the orginial and altered picture look we decided that it would be most effective to end with eating disorders since it was the most powerful part. At this part we showed images of people with eating disorders and also a women talking about her struggle with eating disorders.</p>
		<p>Overall this project was not as difficult as I thought that it would be. Most of our time as a group was probably spent trying to put the video together on IMoive. Even though most of us did not have an idea what we were doing we were able to figure parts out that we did not know prior. I was lucky to have a group that worked very well together and thankfully did not wait until last minute to put the project together. Everyone in the group did thier job equally and for the most part not only one person pulled all the wieght in the group. In the end I was very happy with our documentary and very pleased with the group that I worked with.</p>
