			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>To help fight the unrealistic outcome of Photoshop, Aerie, a teen lingerie company, has stopped Photoshopping their models. An Aerie model named Amber Tolliver, spoke out against the unrealistic image that they were giving teens. She admits that it was nice to see her insecurities go away at the blink of an eye, but it was not really her she was seeing anymore. "To recreate a human being using a computer process is a bit of an attack on who you naturally are," says Amber. "Like, if I'm not good enough or if I'm not beautiful enough, then why'd you book me?” (Popp). The campaign is trying to prove what the medias portrayal is on teens and how without Photoshop, teens and women can gather themselves to believe that most women are not perfect. With high hopes, they can show that most women are naturally imperfect. Beauty is not defined as skinny or tan, but as a combination of qualities, such as shape, color, or form, that pleases the aesthetic senses. Beauty is something that pleases ones self. Magazine and media portrayals not only lower self-esteem in many young women, but also cause serious health issues, mainly eating disorders. In the end, these magazines using Photoshop are not benefiting anyone but only hurting the women in the society.</p>
