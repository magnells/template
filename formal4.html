			<p>If an orthopedic surgeon has gone through a fellowship in order to practice in a subspecialty, they will often work in a hospital and office consisting for solo-practitioners. The days mainly depend on the patient. Certain days of the week will be spent in the emergency room of a hospital doing surgeries; other days will be spent in the office working with patients with scheduled appointments. Although if an emergency were to arise, there is a room in the office where the surgeon could do a surgery. When an emergency arises, the surgeon is notified right away by a receptionist at the emergency room. For this reason, surgeons are always on call. Being in a subspecialty like a hand surgeon like Dr. Magnell requires around the clock hours due to numerous accidents that occur daily. Even though being a solo practitioner can be a lot of work due to the fact one is working on his or her own, it can also be a very flexible job. With numerous surgeons working in the same office all on their own schedules, it is easy to take time off; although, the job itself it still very busy and rigorous (Sobol).</p>
