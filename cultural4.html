			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Even though these women often look tan, skinny, and beautiful; in reality they are mostly bone and clearly too skinny.  Women on the front pages of these magazines have porcelain skin, a perfect bronze tan, and of course a flat stomach.  However, it is more than likely that these women do not really look like that. Most of their bodies are unrealistically touched up with Photoshop. Magazines may find this as nothing more than fixing up their models, but there is a more serious issue behind Photoshop.  Even though magazines think they may just be touching up little flaws or imperfections, they are also changing the perception of how women view themselves. If models on magazines can look this way, many young women believe that they can also achieve this body; when in reality, the models themselves do not look like that. This is where eating disorders may start to occur. If a women’s everyday workout is not doing the trick, they believe the mix of cutting back on food along with a rigorous yet more intense workout will allow them to achieve their dream body. “While the vast majority of images of women are being digitally altered, so are our perceptions of normal, healthy, beautiful and attainable” (Lexie and Lindsey Kite PhD). In the end, women are striving for bodies that in reality, most women including models, do not have.</p> 
<p>An eating disorder is any of a range of psychological disorders characterized by abnormal or disturbed eating habits. Eating disorders are not simply missing meals everyday, but are diseases that can be in need of medical attention along with rehabilitation. People who struggle with eating disorders often have an unrealistic idea and image of their body.  As a result, they ender eating habits that affect their everyday activities and bodily functions. This is because victims not only deal with the lack of energy from the lack of food but they also go through serious emotional problems. Victims use food- whether it is binge eating, which is eating sufficient amounts of foods in one sitting, or Anorexia Nervosa, which is keeping their selves from in taking anything to feel as they are in control of themselves once again. For victims to be treated they may need extensive psychotherapy or psychological counseling. They may also be in need of being monitored insuring that they are in taking the healthy amount of nutrients. If these disorders are not treated, the victim can ender serious health problems and the disorder can even become fatal (National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders).</p>
