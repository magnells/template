			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Students who take the time to spend endless amounts of hours studying and preparing for medical school and who work their way to a residency find their time and endless hard work well spent. The occupation of medical personnel is very rewarding, not only in the prestige of the title, but also in the income. As shown below, most medical occupations pay extremely well and subspecialties can pay even better. Not only a job held by a surgeon well paying, but also it is also long lasting. Surgeons can continue surgery until they are seventy years of age. If they are not ready to stop working, many can still work in the office without performing surgeries. Other surgeons, often known for orthopedics can take up a profession of a professor teaching at a university (Magnell).  In the end, even though it may have seemed like a long road, the time and money spent in a studentâ€™s education and medical school will pay off.
