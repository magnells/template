			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Many widely purchased women’s magazines contain information explaining how to get a “slim sexy body,” or how to cut 400 calories out of your day. After reading these quotes on the front of the magazine containing a skinny beautiful celebrity on the cover, it is already obvious why magazines affect so many women. After opening the magazine it shows not only more “beautiful” women, but also instructions on how to achieve this goal. They may show certain workouts that celebrities do along with a diet. Although, the diet and workout does not always match up; in fact the portions given are often unhealthy. The amount of workout output does not match up to the intake of food. The amount of food given may not even the reach the minimum amount of calories that are supposed to be eaten every day. For example, in Shape magazine an article explains a weight loss pill that can slim your body in just 30 days, “As incredible as it sounds, groundbreaking research has just identified a compound that can not only help you lose weight, but can actually reshape your entire body, reducing waist size, hip size, thigh and buttock circumference, belly bulge, and… last but not least… cause a significant loss of actual fat mass from all over your body” (Strobel). They of course call this pill the “miracle pill.” On the next page it gives an eating plan to go along with the pill. It explains that the user should drink 3 cups of green tea which speeds your metabolism to burn more calories, excludes any form of meat getting protein through a handful of nuts and to eat plenty of fruits in vegetables. On top of the eating pill and insufficient diet it says to work out everyday. How can you possibly workout out everyday while eating nothing and be healthy? Well it is not possible. In a way, the magazine instructions are clearly showing how to have an unhealthy diet leading to a possible eating disorder.</p>
