			<p>An orthopedic surgeon is a surgeon who is trained to treat and diagnose injuries having to do with the musculoskeletal system. They may treat injuries involving torn ligaments, sprains, tendon injuries, arthritis, fractures and so on. The career path for an orthopedic surgeon is long like all medical careers, but it is one of the most rigorous paths. This occupation involves 4 years of completed college, 4 completed years of medical school and generally 5 years of accredited graduate medical education such as a residency program. Also there is another required year if a subspecialty is taken. After an orthopedic surgeon finishes their residency they must become licensed by the state that they work in. Generally to become certified, surgeons must have a degree from medical school and have already finished their full years of residency and are licensed. Orthopedic surgeons are also often certified professors in the medical field. When practicing orthopedics, they are generally in one of three situations which include solo practitioners, orthopedic groups or multi-specialty groups. Surgeons that are solo practitioners work for themselves. They may share an office with other surgeons who are also solo practitioners. Surgeons working in orthopedic groups share the same office and see each other’s patients. Within the groups there may be generalists and specialists that focus on certain areas different from the others in the group. These orthopedic groups consist of two to six surgeons working together. Lastly, multi- specialty groups include a large number of surgeons who together work along side other specialists. The larger the groups of surgeons, the more specialties are represented (Fischer). The day of an orthopedic surgeon mainly depends on the injuries of patients that they will be seeing that day. They diagnose and assess patient’s injuries or diseases by taking test or X-rays. When a problem is recognized, orthopedic surgeons generally try to implement a treatment that is not invasive such as rehabilitation or medication. Although, if surgical repair is needed they will do so using plates or other mechanisms to fix the bone or joint that needs repair (Timmons). Today the technology to not only observe the injury but also treat the area has come a long way. Surgeries are now easier and less messy. When performing surgeries today on the knee for example, doctors have the capability to make a tiny incision barely leaving a scar. Once this incision is made they are able to stick a small tube with a camera that displays on the screen to fix the torn muscle or ligament cleanly. Also with advanced technology, doctors cause also discover diseases earlier maximizing the patients outcome (Sobol).  </p>
