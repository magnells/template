			<p>I conducted an interview with Professor Dr. Magnell at Oakland University who is also a surgeon specializing in Orthopedics. At Oakland University he is the Associate Professor of Orthopedic Surgery and is the Director of Hand Surgery. His classes consist of medical students and residents working in the field with him. Students usually see his teaching styles in their last two years of medical school and into their residency. The students are either in a classroom setting with a lecture about his specialized work, hand surgery. Other times he will work with residents one on one at the office or in a surgical setting. In the classroom one may go through tutorials about prepping students for real life surgeries and experiences. Full time residents that are out of medical school mainly work and train in hospitals or specialized offices similar to where Dr. Magnell works with his residents. They stand by and watch and at times are given the opportunity to take over operations with teacher supervision (Magnell). 
After medical school, a student sets out to find a residency program. Residency is the mandatory training that follows medical school. These programs were created to let students gain experience in a chosen specialty under the supervision of a licensed physician or surgeon. Similarly as applying to medical school, the student also has to apply for a residency. It is possible to obtain a medical license without going through a residency program, although it is usually impossible. Going through a residency program provides a resident to become board certified by the American Board of Specialties. If the board does not certify one, it becomes become very difficult to obtain a job in the medical field. During a residency program the residents are faced with a standardized test called the Internal Medicine In- Training Examination (IM- ITE).  This exam covers the knowledge that the resident should have obtained during their time in the program. Every year in October, residents take this test to self-assess all of the information that they have learned. Some people argue that this test has nothing to do with the background of the residency program (McDonald). Residency normally lasts somewhere around 3 years but it can take up to 6 years if students are looking to be a surgeon. Residency is an extremely tiring and time consuming, but educational experience. Residents work along side doctors or nurses to get the full effect of working in the medical field. This program comes with long hours and many complaints of sleep deprivation.  Many programs are reaching out for more nurses and doctors to work with residents so they can become closer with the job and explain signs of possible sleep deprivation and how to better manage their schedule (Krupa). While in the program, residents are paid but the money that is paid usually goes to paying the bills for the program. On average residents make about $40,000 to $50,000, a year which may seem like a living number, but it is not all that much after the bills are paid (Santiago). The chart below explains the amount of years spent in residency based on the specialty the student chooses.</p>

<p>Specialty:	Length of Training</p>
<p>Emergency Medicine:	3-4 years</p>
<p>Family Practice:	3 years</p>
<p>Internal Medicine:	3 years</p>
<p>Pediatrics:	3 years</p>
<p>Obstetrics-Gynecology:	4 years</p>
<p>Pathology:	4 years</p>
<p>Psychiatry:	4 years</p>
<p>General Surgery:	5 years</p>
<p>Neurological Surgery:	6 years (includes 1 year of general surgery)</p>
<p>Orthopedic Surgery:	5 years (includes 1 year of general surgery)</p>
<p>Otolaryngology:	5 years</p>
<p>Urology:	5 years (includes 1 year of general surgery)</p>
<p>Plastic Surgery:	6 years</p>
<p>Anesthesiology:	3 years plus PGY-1 Transitional/Preliminary</p>
<p>Dermatology:	3 years plus PGY-1 Transitional/Preliminary</p>
<p>Neurology:	3 years plus PGY-1 Transitional/Preliminary</p>
<p>Ophthalmology:	3 years plus PGY-1 Transitional/Preliminary</p>
<p>Physical Medicine:	3-4 years</p>
<p>Diagnostic Radiology:	4 years plus PGY-1 Transitional/Preliminary</p>
<p>Radiation Oncology:	4 years plus PGY-1 Transitional/Preliminary</p>
<p>Transitional/Preliminary:	1 year</p>

<p>The most demanding experience for top tier students that requires the maximum years of residency for a medical background is a surgeon. After medical school, like all other medical occupations, surgeons continue learning through residency programs that can take up to 6 years, depending on the specialty one wishes to have. Specialties that can be studied include; general surgery, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery or urology. After residency the new orthopedic surgeon can choose to be a general orthopedic surgeon, or they can apply for a fellowship program. This is similar to a residency because the student is still working beside a teacher, but they have chosen to take another year of residency to be a fellow or to take up a subspecialty. If a resident has chosen to be an orthopedic surgeon, they may take up the subspecialty of a hand surgeon, like Dr. Magnell. During a fellowship, one can earn a scholarship or be personally funded. A fellowship is not a requirement for all surgeons but having one can make a big difference on a resume. A fellowship can be over a span of many years if the fellow is doing research (What is a Fellowship?). Even more occasionally, but worth the chance of taking one more year is the possible option of a job. Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Sobol, was offered a job through his fellowship program.  It can provide a surgeon with an easy access into a job market that can be extremely competitive (Sobol).
