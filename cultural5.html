			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>After being exposed to this type of demeaning media for so long, it is hard to get away from it. Women immerse themselves in it like critical cultural research. People become so obsessed with losing weight and trying to become perfect that we forget who we truly are. They lose themselves. For so long we have been told that you need to be thin and pretty and tan and in perfect shape in order to get people to notice you or like you so naturally we pick apart, over analyze and criticize ourselves.  Women wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and start to believe that we are not truly beautiful because we do not have all those things the models in magazines do.  Women may find themselves wearing looser clothes so their “belly” does not show, bigger jeans so those love handles are not exposed, put on more makeup to hide that greasy skin, leave their hair down so people cannot see your big nose and undefined cheek bones.  Soon after that, comes the need to be skinny resorting to dangerous eating disorders to take back control over the body.  Women see themselves as disappointment; blame their “unattractive” bodies and affecting self-esteem because they see their “imperfections” or things models have that they do not.</p></p>
