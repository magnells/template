			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>There are a variety of requirements that an undergraduate must fulfill before they can apply to their chosen medical school. These requirements include biology, chemistry, math, and other kinds of courses, depending on what a student may want to specialize in. After these requirements have been completed, a student is faced with the important MCAT exam. If the student started their road to Pre-Med as a freshmen, this test will generally take place sometime during the middle of the student’s junior year in college.  After the MCAT, when applying for medical school the school’s admission advisors will generally look at your GPA and MCAT scores to determine if you would be a good fit for their program. They also consider extra-curricular activities, prior experience, volunteering, and internships for acceptance.  Many well-known medical schools may not accept a student if they have had no background experience that involves the medical field.
