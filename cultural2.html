			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p> 
When women look in the mirror, what do they see?  Do they see someone with sheer confidence?  Someone to be proud of?  Or someone embarrassed to be seen, maybe even ashamed to look at? Over the years, the media has done a fantastic job of diminishing what little self-esteem we as young women and teenage girls have left. We are taught at a young age that image is everything.  Whether it was Barbie and Ken, or even the infamous brat dolls, we all had one.  Why?  Because everyone did, they were our idea of perfect.  They had no flaws, how could they?  Everyone loved them. They had perfectly sculpted bodies, clear porcelain skin, good hair, nice legs, large breasts, six packs, gorgeous eyes, and of course a perfect smile.  We all wanted to be exactly like them. When we get older we start to obsess about the bodies of celebrities that we see in magazines. They are flawless and skinny. Young women and teens now wish to look like these “role models” like they did to their Barbie’s. In reality these celebrities in magazines are almost as unrealistic as their dolls. By buying these products we are taught that these plastic dolls are perfect, a social construction of reality. We have created a completely unrealistic ideology of ourselves and the general public itself.
