			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Taking on an occupation in the medical field is a very long and rewarding journey. There are several steps in becoming a member of medical personnel. First one needs to get their normal undergraduate degree of four years, with an ending result of a Bachelor’s Degree. During these first four years one must take a placement test called the MCAT. The MCAT’s results determine if applicant will be continuing in the medical field. If the student achieves a high score, the average score is 30 on the MCAT, then the student can then apply for medical school, which is another four years of education. Following medical school, a student will become a resident; gaining residency at a hospital or office specialized in the training program that the student is going into. By the end of internships, training, and becoming specialized, one will generally have 11 to 15 years of experience in their chosen field.  Deciding to go into the medical field involves immense amounts of dedication, time, hard work, and studying. Only the best GPA and MCAT scorers will be accepted to their desired medical schools. </p>
