			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>Medical school is a very long process and a very costly process. The goal of most is to spend the least amount of time in medical school as possible to save money. Many students accumulate a debt between $100,000 and $250,000 by the time they are finished with medical school. Many who cannot fully pay for school themselves depend on loans and other financial aid provided by the school they attend. Loans involved with medical school can be extremely high compared to the other majors offered at a chosen university. Debt for medical students can easily accumulate to over $100,000 over the course of just a few years. An article by Bloomberg illustrates this dangerous debt with a student named Matthew Moy who is currently attending Illinois University in the medical field and has already accumulated $190,000 in debt and still has a year of medical school to go.  He explains how the thought of the amount loans that keeps on growing that he has to pay back in the future scares him. Matthew says, “When I think about it, it will keep me up all night. I’m dreading the exit interview when I found out exactly how much I’ll have to pay back.” Matthew and his father’s loans were compared to the time when his father attended medical school in 1970. As one would expect, the rates to become a doctor in 1970 were much lower than they are today. In 2012, the average debt for medical-school graduates was $170,000 and in 1978 the rate was $13,469. This difference between these two numbers is unbelievable and could very possibly deter a student who is looking into entering the medical field. The loans that are in place now and in the future call for possible shortages in doctors and surgeons (Lorin).</p>
<p>After completing an undergraduate degree, a student can start to consider the type of medical school that they would like to attend. There are a few types that differ in the ease of acceptance based on scores of the MCAT and GPA, and also differ in the amount of years spent studying and the levels of prestige. The main two types of medical schools include allopathic (MD) and osteopathic (DO). Both types of medical schools teach the same curriculum that is necessary to be a doctor in a chosen field, but they differ in the approaches used and in admission requirements. The Allopathic schools approach varies in the time spent studying basic sciences and time spent in residency. Students who use osteopathic approach learn the same concepts as allopathic students but they focus more on therapeutic ways of treatment. There may be a stronger focus on how to diagnose and treat patients and how to physically treat injuries. When deciding what type of schooling to take on, it’s best to look at students MCAT scores and their GPA. Generally the lower tier students might apply for a DO or osteopathic schools due to the ease of admission. The MD or allopathic school is known to be more prestige accepting the top tier students from well-known medical universities (Prep). The chart below shows the minimum and average statistics for students applying to medical school. Usually if a student is anywhere below average they may want to consider osteopathic schools rather than allopathic.</p>

<p>Once accepted into a medical school, the fun begins and it is more of a realistic and intense experience. In the teaching of medicine today, there are generally two different kinds of approaches. There is the traditional curriculum and the integrated/ problem based learning curriculum. In the traditional approach, the first two years of courses are mainly taken similar to the way an undergraduate takes their courses. They take classes on the basic sciences such as anatomy, biology and so on. In the integrated approach, the classes taken the first two years are all related to a similar topic. A student may take the same classes as someone from the traditional approach like anatomy and biology but the integrated approach will strictly focus on one system, such as the muscular system. This approach is looked down upon by some experienced members of the medical field because its thought to be based on one topic, so students may be missing important points that would normally be explained in a regular standard biology class. The last two years spent in the classes of both approaches are similar by which working in contact with patients and clinical hours, but, the integrated style may have you working with patients sooner than traditional (Becker).</p>
