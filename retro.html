			<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
 
	<p>The four papers I have written throughout this course have each tested different writing skills. The writing that I was assigned to do in this class was different than any of the writing I was assigned to do in high school. This semester’s papers brought out a variety of different writing styles that I had never used in past classes. Each paper asked direct questions that required me to write in a different way each time; whether it was using my own thoughts, doing research to form a report, or reflecting on a personal life experience. Each paper involved a different style of thinking, and sometimes I was forced to look at things in ways that I may have not before. This class brought out aspects of writing that I had not known existed prior to the class, which helped me as a writer significantly. This writing course showed me that seemingly endless practice and careful revision can tremendously improve not just my writing skills, but my performance in any class.</p>
	<p>Our first paper, Lived Experiences, had me compose a paper explaining my major and how technology is linked to my major, business.  In order to do this I had to think of all of the ways that I believed that business depended on or created technology.  As I was writing my paper, I found myself becoming bored with the research regarding the mix of business and technology. I viewed numerous sites and found the vital information I needed to finish my paper. My father, who is a business owner running an IT company, explained to me in numerous ways that companies depend on technology to keep their business efficient and successful.  I had no idea that businesses depended on technology so much. This was the first time I had to ask other individuals about information on a subject and use that information to make it into an organized and logical paper.  I had trouble writing this paper due to the lack of prior knowledge I retained about the subject before the assignment. Again, I found myself researching about how technology is linked to marketing or accounting. Unfortunately, I still lacked interest in all of the information I was reading about technology and business. This assignment was very important to me because I realized, if I was bored from simply reading information about the subject, do I really think I can have a satisfying career from it? After completing my paper, I started to look for a new major that peaked my interest. My formal research project was an indicator to what I was truly interested in for my future, which ended up being in the medical field.</p> 
	<p>The Cultural Analysis paper was the first paper in the class where we were able to choose our own topic and express how we felt about it while backing up our beliefs using solid information and resources.  For this paper, I decided to do the topic of photoshop, otherwise known as photo editing.  I also choose to do this topic for my remix project as well.  After looking at a variety of sites about issues in our society, I decided that there was an abundance of information about the topic, and as a bonus I could also relate to the issue at hand.  I found myself enjoying and learning about the steps of photoshop and how much simply changing a picture can affect people. After looking at statistics and learning about the outcomes of editing photos, I strongly believe that the act of photoshop is not only changing the appearance of a person to make them look like something they are not, but there is no benefit to photoshopping.  Photoshop only impacts people in a negative way. From that point on, I was able to compose a strong paper explaining the consequences of Photoshop and why it should be eradicated.  When it came time to turn in my final paper, I found that I was not only more educated in the current issue of Photoshop, but I also felt very confident about the quality of the paper that I had turned in.</p> 
<p>	The Formal Research paper was by far the most difficult and time consuming paper that I wrote for this class.  At first, deciding the topic was very difficult. After some unsuccessful research, I started to look into the medical field. I was very intrigued in the topic of medicine so I decided to write about it.  During the course of this assignment, I spent an immense amount of time doing research to find information about many aspects of the medical field. I decided to research the requirements needed to be a doctor.  Throughout the writing process, I managed to narrow down my career options to an orthopedic surgeon. Everything that I was researching about orthopedic surgery fascinated me. As a result of this, I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in the medical field in the future. The fact that I was interested in what I was writing, like the Cultural Analysis paper, made it much easier to finish my paper.  I did my two interviews with a professor and an orthopedic surgeon. I had plenty of questions to ask because I was so interested about the topic and was I actually very excited about this assignment.  Finally, after learning all the necessary information, it was time to format it all into a final report.  This was the hardest part of the project for me because I had to visit numerous sites in order to learn how to correctly put a report together. After figuring out how to construct a formal report, I found that I had not collected enough information and I had to continue looking for more to complete my report. As a result of doing all of this research, I learned more about the medical field and what kinds of skills and requirements are necessary in order to pursue a career in this field.  This paper was definitely a challenge for me, but in the end it was worth all of the hard work because I found a more suitable major for myself that I was genuinely interested in, and for that I will be forever grateful.</p>
	<p>The last assignment for this class that I had to complete was the Remix Project.  This assignment was different than anything I had ever done in the past.  In this project I had to take a piece that I had already written in the past and figure out a way to persuade my audience to feel as I do about the issue through a documentary. This was a challenging assignment for me not only because I had to share my ideas with a group, but also because I had to figure out a way to present the documentary in a way that would capture the audience’s interest so that they would be hooked into watching it. I wanted my audience to feel similarly as to I did about my topic when they finished watching the documentary. For this project, my group and I chose to make a documentary based on the process of Photoshop.  I was very interested in learning about the effects this issue had on society but I was not sure how we were going to be able to make a documentary out of it.  Finally, we decided to arrange the documentary in a way that would pull the audience’s interest near the beginning and keep their interest until the end.  As a result, we hoped that the ending would have a strong impact on the audience and help make it clear that Photoshop has severe effects on society.  For our documentary, we chose to share information about eating disorders and include mortifying and impactful pictures to show the effect eating disorders have on people.  After seeing the damaging effects that Photoshop can cause, I would hope that the audience would feel the way I do about the subject.</p> 												    
	<p> In the end, I realized that these assignments not only helped me grow as a writer, but they also made me aware of a variety of new information that concerns my potential future career field. As a result of this, I am very satisfied with the work I completed and turned in for this class. I learned how to broaden my horizons, ask the right questions during interviews, gather good information and facts, and formalize a report. As this class went on I became very fond of the class structure because I was able to see the improvement I was making in the class and with my writing skill after every paper that I turned in. Looking back at my first paper compared to writing this reflection assignment, I can see the significant improvement I have made in just over one semester. Being able to see my improvement is a very exciting feeling not only because it is rewarding toward my GPA but because it also motivates me to continue trying to improve my writing. At the end of this semester I have come to the conclusion that Science and Technology has become my favorite class, mainly for the reason that it has challenged me to do my best more than any other class I have had. In conclusion it is very rewarding to see my hard work resulting with a respectable grade.</p>
