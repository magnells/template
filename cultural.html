			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>The media is not only inescapable from most of society, but it is also difficult to avoid the messages that they are sending. This is mostly visible in young women and teens. The media is supposed to portray women of beauty.  However, their idea of beauty is when women have bones poking through their stomachs, sticks for legs, and severely unhealthy eating habits. Sadly, many women strive to be like these “beautiful” women. In the United States today, 11 million people struggle with an eating disorder. Most cases can often be cured through rehabilitation.  Although without help, these disorders can be fatal. Magazines constantly give tips on how to stay thin and give negative reactions to any kind of body fat. Most of these people in the magazines are celebrities that people look up to and admire. Although in reality, their so called “role models” are not sending the right message. Many of these “beautiful” women have been Photoshopped to perfection- being the women that they even wished they could be. In reality these magazines are taking the idea of ‘’beautiful’’ to a dangerous and unrealistic level. </p>
