		<h1>lived experiences</h1>

 	<p>My dad went to college for a business marketing and management degree. Using his degree he created and now owns a consulting company whose clients include both automotive and financial companies.  His company helps create and deploy software and applications that make his clients more efficient and keep them on the cutting edge of technology.  His company consists mostly of technical and IT employees who create technological products to meet the needs of the clients.  He has always told me how the introduction of the internet has changed the face of business.  Companies now expect and demand innovative ways to make their companies work faster and smarter.  His company tries to fill these needs with new technological ideas and has to work with clients from inception to completion of the ideas.  I believe to be successful in his company I would like to major in marketing and also minor in information technology.</p>
	<p>To start the whole process with his clients he has to market his company and show them how new technology solutions will increase efficiencies or making small improvements to current technologies will put them on the cutting edge. This is the part that I found extremely interesting making me interested in the IT and business world. For example, my dad worked with Verizon and created apps for phones, mostly on Droids. He assists in many of the applications that are made on the phones but the one that I sat in on was for an application that links functions of the car with your cell phone.  For example if your keys are locked in a car the application with a certain code, can unlock the vehicle. It can also turn the car on before you get in the car. It has settings allowing a person to heat it up before they get in the car or even a control over the air conditioning. They are still working on this and additional applications to continually entice new customers and keep their clients happy. Projects like this also have to take into the consideration of the auto company who is putting the matching technology in the car. Therefore another part of his job consists of communicating with both companies meeting the needs and deadlines that they both want. This is where it can become difficult. One customer may want things done sooner than the other and become irritated when it’s not.</p> 
	<p>Another project that my dad dealt with was through General Motors. His company was one of the few companies that has been with Onstar since its inception. I have found this extremely interesting since Onstar has been around since the early 90’s and is forever changing due to changing technology demands and new devices.  OnStar assists many needs of the driver. One may be simply asking for directions. The owner of the car can hit the OnStar button in their car and will be directed to a person taking the address. After the person enters the address, it can be linked to the car which displays the directions if the car allows it or says it out loud. Another function of OnStar which it is mostly known for is assisting people whether it be they locked their keys in their car or got in an accident and need immediate help. If someone has locked their keys in the car, likewise to the app he created they can connect to the car and unlock it. Also if someone is in an accident, instead of searching for their phone, they can just hit the OnStar button and will be linked to a OnStar employee like you do when you call for directions. They will right away connect to the nearest police department and stay on the phone with you until they have arrived.</p>
	<p>After hearing about how his employees create these things I have an interest in working for my dad. I would like to be able to help the customer come up with ideas for their products. I think brainstorming the products would be the most exciting part. They get a basis of instructions and with their own imagination come up with a completely new product. Not only are these products interesting in the making, but they also help people. I really like the idea that when I am coming up with these ideas it’s going to help make peoples life easier and safer.</p>
	<p>Based on discussion with my dad about his company I have been able to figure what courses I need to take and which schools to apply for. I am taking classes to major in business marketing area and also hopefully some IT classes. The marketing side of his business is also linked to the technology that they create. Sometimes they create products that the customer does not specifically ask for, therefore they need sales people. The marketing side of his business tries to sell the products they make. While trying to sell the products they have to know the function and the price needed to create it. I think this part of the business would be very exciting to deal with. The sales people get to meet with many different people and get to travel all over the world to meet with other companies and sell these products. Part of his business is based in India where a lot of the sales happen. I think it would be exciting to travel with work. As I explained before, his company also makes the products. That’s where the IT part of schooling would come in. A lot of this part of the creation is done on the computer. I would need to take computer related courses. The part of the business I would most likely stay away from would be the building side. This part of the business deals with engineering which I think would be extremely difficult and I do not find a lot of interest in.</p> 
<p>My dad has been a big part of my inspiration of what I hope to do with my future. He has let me become involved in his work letting me able to see exactly what I want to do. I find his work with technology extremely interesting and I hope to carry on what he has started. First working for his company, I hope to deal with the marketing side as I discussed earlier. After getting to know the business and how it runs, I hope to deal with the IT side while running it all. In this I get to help come up with the product and deal with the customer which I think would be very exciting. While still in college I hope to intern through his company and become in even more involved.  Most of all I hope I get the chance to make it into the Broad Business school here at Michigan State so I can become more involved with technology. All in all, my dad has become an extreme inspiration to me and my hopes for my future.</p>
