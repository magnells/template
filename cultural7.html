			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>There is no escaping the twig models and the six feet tall runway girls who look like they have not eaten in weeks, but that is irrelevant.  There are other things out there aside from obsessing over these so-called “perfect” people.  Girls need to learn to be comfortable in their own skin.  To have self- confidence and appreciate who they are and what they look like.  Yes there will always be the skinny blonde cheerleader in the movies, but who cares?  Every girl should be able to look into a mirror and be satisfied with her reflection, without wanting to cringe, without being filled with disappointment, and without being dissatisfied.  They should be allowed to walk down the street or the hallway without the fear of being ridiculed or being used as race and gender markers.  To be able to believe in themselves and embrace their imperfections, for that is what true beauty is all about. </p>
